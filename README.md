# vidclipper-frontend

This is the frontend SPA for [vidclipper-server](https://github.com/nikita-skobov/vidclipper-server).

See the documentation there for full build/run instructions.

But here you will find the instructions to build the frontend static files:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nikita-skobov/vidclipper-frontend
cd vidclipper-frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a `build/` directory that will contain the static files that will be served by the vidclipper-server.
